      Vestal <br>
      Vestal is a business concept I pitched to investors at the 2016 Power Pitch Competition at <br>
      the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. The idea was a virtual-reality based social <br>
      network where you could interact with others using just a Google Cardboard Viewer and a smartphone.
      <br> <br>
      In addition to a full-length investor pitch, I also had the opportunity to pitch my idea in a matter <br>
      of seconds to many people. An aid I used was a quick demo on a Galazy S5 that showed the <br>
      capabilities of what Virtual Reality and Vestal could do. A video of the demo is below. <br><br>
