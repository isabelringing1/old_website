	<p>Hi! My name is Isabel Lee. This is a place where you'll be able to see all the cool stuff I have done in recent years. A good place to look is in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
	<br><br>
	I am a senior at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy in Aurora, Illinois, and will continue my education at Yale University this fall. This probably goes without saying, but I do a lot of math and science. You can see all of that in my <a href="/resume">resume</a>.
	<br><br>
	Hopefully, this page will grow bigger and more impressive as the years pass, but for now, feel free to look around at what I have so far. 
	<br><br>
	You can contact me at isabelringing1@gmail.com.</p>
